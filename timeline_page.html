	<h4>Humans have been consuming eggs since the beginning of time. How they figured eggs were nutritious and not a poisonous substance I cannot say, but we have never lost that tradition. Perhaps we Paleolithic people observed another animal safely eating an egg and so we decided to follow suit. Humans are capable of eating and digesting raw eggs but I wouldn't advise it unless the egg is professionally prepared (such as from a restaurant). Raw eggs are known to potentially possess the bacteria Salmonella, which cause stomach cramps, diarrhea, and fever. Salmonella may pass on its own without treatment, but in some cases, it can cause extreme dehydration and even death. In any case, it is a nasty and uncomfortable disease to have.</h4><br>

      <div class="info">Since the Ancient Romans did not have the knowledge about manipulating the genetic code for hens, their eggs came in many different sizes and shapes. Big eggs were popular, so some believed creating concoctions of spices, earth, and wine would help the hens deliver what the people wanted. With the development of pottery and clay pots, the hardboiled egg was invented. While we consider them a part of the main course, the Ancient Romans ate them as appetizers.</div>

      <div class="info">Chicken eggs were the most common food consumed during this time (except perhaps bread). Not only were they quick and esay to cook but also cheap. It is now that eggs became so diverse in forms; the Europeans made boiled, fried, scrambled, and poached eggs. Sometimes, hard-boiled eggs were mixed with other ingredients for a dish. </div>

      <div class="info">Parisians have always used and enjoyed the versatile egg. Louis XV ate many hard-boiled eggs during his reign and even had a known routine of hacking off the top with his spoon. An announcer would yell out "The King is about to eat his eggs." Soft-boiled eggs were recommended to those with sensitive stomachs because they were considered easier to digest due to their soft, light nature.</div>
