	<h4>Hi! And welcome to an Egg's journey through the times and ways of their making. Many people consider eggs to be a nutritious and quick breakfast or meal component because they contain protein and important nutrients to the body. However, some may not take a liking to the famous egg, and that's totally fine. Please join me on this adventure where we explore the beginning of eggs and how and when specific egg dishes were created. I think it will be fun and knowledgable!</h4>
	<h2>Anatomy and Physiology</h2>
	<p>Now, let us look at what makes an egg and where they come from. To be specific, we will be discussing a chicken's egg. People eat eggs from other poultry as well but that is not what we will be talking about today.</p><br>
	<img id="chicken" src="images/chicken_anatomy.jpg" alt="Chicken Anatomy">
	<p>First, we should understand how eggs come to be laid. Such as many female animals, female chickens--hens--have developing eggs in their ovaries. These are called ova, and are the yellow yolk in an egg. Through a cycle, the unfertilized egg is released from the ovary into the oviduct, where layers of albumen (the protein, or egg white), protective membranes, and shell are added to the ova. In total, this takes about 26 hours, or a little more than a day. The eggs exit through the cloaca, and although the cloaca also sees the expulsion of solid and liquid waste, the egg never comes in contact with these matters because the cloaca turns inside out. An unfertilized egg is what humans cook and eat, and no, they are not baby chickens because the sperm from the male chicken never reached the ova. The amount of eggs produced from a hen depends on the breed and their environment. The process of creating and releasing the egg takes a major toll on the hen's body. In general, a wild hen lays 13 to 18 eggs a year, which is much lower than what the majority believe. Commercial hens, which produce for human consumption, are made to produce about 250 to 300 eggs a year; this leaves them tired and most likely mentally drained.</p>

	<h2>Why Eggs?</h2>

	<p>For an average sized egg (about 50 g), these are the nutritional facts:</p>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<th>Calories</th>
			<th>Protein</th>
			<th>Fat</th>
			<th>Carbohydrates</th>
			<th>Cholesterol</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>75 cal</td>
			<td>6 g</td>
			<td>5 g</td>
			<td>0.6 g</td>
			<td>187 mg</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<p>Eggs are considered the perfect health option because their calorie count is not obnoxiously high and they pack a good amount of protein. What most people worry about is the cholesterol level. Cholesterol is used within the body to build and repair cells, but too much can be harmful. Cholesterol can be made from the human liver and consumed from foods such as meat, eggs, and diary. The blood carries cholesterol, but with too much cholesterol, there is the potential to clog an artery from fatty build up. These can lead to heart attacks, heart disease, and strokes. If this is worrisome, it is always possible to leave out the yolk and consume mostly egg white, which contains no cholesterol.</p><br>
	<p>In addition, the egg carries a myriad of important vitamins and minerals. They are rich in vitamin B12, which the body cannot synthesize on its own, vitamin B2, vitamin B5, vitamin A, and selenium. To add, eggs carry amounts of most vitamins and minerals but in smaller amounts than the ones listed previously. However, if one wishes to recieve these other nutrients, they will need to consume the egg yolk because the egg white contains only protien. This coould be troublesome to those who are seeking lower cholesterol intake. There are discussions about whether or not egg cholesterol has any real effect on cardiovascular congestion and disease. Eggs also have choline, an essential nutrient that is a part of the B-complex vitamins and exetremely benecial to brain health and function.</p>
